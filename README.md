# Anxiety Adventure
DH 150 Digital Storytelling Final Project


Hello! 

Inspired by Depression Quest by ZoÃ« Quinn, Anxiety Adventure was developed to depict one person's experience with generalized anxiety disorder. However, everyone who has anxiety has their own unique experiences, and the game's depiction is only one example. It is not representative or all-encompassing of all aspects of anxiety, its symptoms, or its outcomes. If you believe you are suffering from severe anxiety, recieving treatment from a mental health professional is highly encouraged before continuing.
